# 🔧 DNS Issue Resolution

## ⚠️ Issue Found

When testing the setup, we discovered that **DNS is not configured yet**:

```
nslookup hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
Server:  MCCDNS01-2016.costaatt.edu.tt
Address:  10.2.0.24

*** MCCDNS01-2016.costaatt.edu.tt can't find hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt: Non-existent domain
```

This means your system administrator either:
1. **Hasn't created the DNS entry yet**
2. **Created it but it hasn't propagated yet** (can take up to 24 hours)
3. **Created it with a different name**

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've configured Apache to work **with or without DNS**. The system now works with:

### **Option 1: Using IP Address (Works Now)**
```
http://10.2.1.27        → Redirects to HTTPS
https://10.2.1.27       → Your HR System ✅
```

### **Option 2: Using Domain Name (When DNS is Ready)**
```
http://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt    → Redirects to HTTPS
https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt   → Your HR System ✅
```

Both URLs will work with the same clean, professional interface!

## 📋 Action Items for System Administrator

**Please ask your system administrator to:**

1. **Create DNS A Record:**
   - **Name:** `hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt`
   - **Type:** A Record
   - **Value/IP:** `10.2.1.27`
   - **TTL:** 3600 (or default)

2. **Optional - Create www subdomain:**
   - **Name:** `www.hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt`
   - **Type:** CNAME
   - **Value:** `hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt`

3. **Verify DNS propagation:**
   After creating the record, test with:
   ```powershell
   nslookup hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   ```
   
   Should return:
   ```
   Name:    hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   Address:  10.2.1.27
   ```

## 🔄 Once DNS is Working

Once your system administrator confirms the DNS entry is created and working:

1. **Test DNS resolution:**
   ```powershell
   nslookup hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   ```
   
   Should show: `Address:  10.2.1.27`

2. **Access via domain name:**
   ```
   https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   ```

3. **Share with users:**
   Tell your users to use `https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt` instead of the IP address

## 📊 Current Configuration Status

✅ **Apache** - Running and configured
✅ **SSL Certificate** - Created and installed  
✅ **Virtual Host** - Configured for both IP and domain name
✅ **Backend** - Running (hr-backend)
✅ **Frontend** - Running (hr-frontend)
✅ **Firewall** - Ports 80 and 443 open
⏳ **DNS** - Waiting for system administrator to create entry

## 🧪 Testing Both Access Methods

### Test with IP Address (Works Now):
```powershell
# HTTP (should redirect to HTTPS)
curl -I http://10.2.1.27

# HTTPS (should work)
curl -k -I https://10.2.1.27
```

### Test with Domain Name (Once DNS is ready):
```powershell
# HTTP (should redirect to HTTPS)
curl -I http://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt

# HTTPS (should work)
curl -k -I https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
```

## 💡 Alternative: Temporary Hosts File Entry

If you need the domain name to work **immediately** for testing, you can add it to your local hosts file:

### On Your Computer:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Add-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Value "`n10.2.1.27    hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt"
   ```

3. Test:
   ```powershell
   nslookup hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   ```

4. Access via:
   ```
   https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
   ```

**Note:** This only works on the computer where you add the hosts entry. Other users won't be able to access it until the actual DNS entry is created.

## 🎯 Summary

### Right Now - Use This:
```
https://10.2.1.27
```

### After DNS is Created - Use This:
```
https://hrpmg.costaatt.edu.tt
```

### Both Will Work!
The system is configured to accept connections via both the IP address and the domain name. Once DNS is working, users can use the cleaner domain name URL.
