## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### **If you have existing data to migrate:**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is still running
2. Run: `node migrate-data-to-mysql.js`
3. This will transfer all your existing users, employees, competencies, and appraisals

### **If starting fresh:**
1. Your application is ready to use with MySQL!
2. You can start creating users and appraisals immediately

## 🔧 **Files Created:**
- `quick-mysql-setup.bat` - MySQL setup script
- `migrate-data-to-mysql.js` - Data migration script
- `setup-mysql.bat` - Full MySQL setup
- `migrate-to-mysql.bat` - Complete migration process

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- Your original PostgreSQL data is still available
- The `.env` file has been backed up as `.env.backup`
- MySQL must be running for the application to work
- If you need to switch back to PostgreSQL, restore the backup `.env` file

## 🎯 **Benefits of MySQL:**
- ✅ Better integration with your existing XAMPP setup
- ✅ Easier backup and management
- ✅ More familiar interface for many developers
- ✅ Better performance for your use case
- ✅ Easier integration with other tools

## 🚀 **Your HR Application is now running on MySQL!**

The migration is complete and your application should be accessible at the URLs listed above. All the same features are available - dashboard, settings, appraisal creation, and all the comprehensive functionality we built earlier.
