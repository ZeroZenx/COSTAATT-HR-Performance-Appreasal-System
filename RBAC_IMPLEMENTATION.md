# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The RBAC system has been fully implemented according to the specification. Employees are properly restricted from creating appraisals, and all role-based access controls are in place.

## 🔐 **Role-Based Access Matrix**

| Feature | EMPLOYEE | SUPERVISOR | HR_ADMIN |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Dashboard** | ✅ (personal) | ✅ (team) | ✅ (global) |
| **My Appraisals** | ✅ (own only) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Create New Appraisal** | ❌ **BLOCKED** | ✅ (team only) | ✅ (all) |
| **Team Appraisals** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **All Appraisals** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Team Directory** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Employee Directory** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Team Reports** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Global Reports** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Settings** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

- ✅ **Self-Assessment**: Can edit only when status is "Self-Assessment"
- ❌ **Manager Fields**: Cannot edit supervisor sections
- ❌ **Team Data**: No access to other employees' data
- ❌ **Global Data**: No access to organization-wide data

## 🎯 **Supervisor Permissions**

- ✅ **"Appraisals"** - Team appraisals only
- ✅ **"Employees"** - Team directory only
- ✅ **"Team Reports"** - Team analytics only
- ✅ **"Competencies"** - Read-only access

### Data Scope
- ✅ **Team Appraisals**: Only appraisals for employees they supervise

- ✅ **Global Reports**: Organization-wide analytics
- ✅ **System Settings**: Template management, cycles, etc.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Core RBAC System (`apps/web/src/lib/rbac.ts`)
```typescript
// Permission checking
RBAC.can(user, action, resource, context)

// Navigation items by role
RBAC.getNavigationItems(user)

// Dashboard widgets by role  
RBAC.getDashboardWidgets(user)

// Data scoping by role
RBAC.getDataScope(user)
```

### Component-Level Protection (`apps/web/src/components/RoleGuard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Conditional rendering
<RoleGuard action="create" resource="appraisal">
  <CreateAppraisalButton />
</RoleGuard>

// Hook for permissions
const { can, isEmployee, isSupervisor, isHRAdmin } = usePermissions();
```

### Route-Level Protection (`apps/web/src/components/RouteGuard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Route protection
<Route 
  path="/appraisals/new" 
  element={
    <RouteGuard action="create" resource="appraisal">
      <CreateAppraisalPage />
    </RouteGuard>
  } 
/>
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### RBAC Test Component
A comprehensive test component (`RBACTest.tsx`) has been added to the dashboard to verify:
- ✅ Current user role and permissions
- ✅ Navigation item visibility
- ✅ Route access permissions
- ✅ Component-level access control
- ✅ Expected behavior by role

### Test Scenarios

#### Employee Login Test:
1. Login as employee
2. Verify "Create New Appraisal" is hidden from navigation
3. Try to access `/appraisals/new` directly → Should redirect to dashboard
4. Try to access `/employees` directly → Should redirect to dashboard
5. Verify only "My Appraisals" shows their own data

#### Supervisor Login Test:
1. Login as supervisor
2. Verify "Create New Appraisal" is visible in navigation
3. Access `/appraisals/new` → Should work
4. Verify "Employees" shows "Team Members"
5. Verify "Reports" shows "Team Reports"

#### HR Admin Login Test:
1. Login as HR admin
2. Verify all navigation items are visible
3. Verify full access to all routes
4. Verify "Employees" shows full directory
5. Verify "Reports" shows global analytics

## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Navigation-Based Access Control**
- Role-specific menu items
- Hidden/visible based on permissions
- Context-aware labels (e.g., "Team Members" vs "Employees")

### 2. **Route-Level Protection**
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
- Access denied messages
- Preserved attempted routes for post-login redirect

### 3. **Component-Level Protection**
- Conditional rendering based on permissions
- Fallback content for unauthorized users
- HOC for component wrapping

### 4. **Data Scoping**
- Employee: Self-only data
- Supervisor: Team-scoped data
- HR Admin: Global data access

### 5. **Workflow Integration**
- Status-based field editing permissions
- Self-assessment field restrictions
- Manager section protection

## 📋 **Compliance with Requirements**

✅ **Employees cannot create appraisals** - Navigation hidden, route blocked
✅ **Only Supervisors and HR can create appraisals** - Proper role checking
✅ **Route `/appraisals/new` is restricted** - RouteGuard implementation
✅ **Employees see only their own appraisals** - Data scoping implemented
✅ **Self-assessment field editing** - Status-based permissions
✅ **Manager field protection** - Role-based field access control

## 🎉 **Result**

The RBAC system is fully functional and compliant with all requirements. Employees are properly restricted from creating appraisals, and the system provides appropriate access levels for each role while maintaining security and usability.
